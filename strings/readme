What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Very helpful and quite fun! I learned a ton about using pointers with
strings. It's a valuable exercise being able to do a task two different
ways (array notation and pointer notation).

will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

Yes, because we know the size of a char (1 byte), and know the number of
chars that will be stored in the destination string (i.e. the length of
the resultant string). For Str_copy, the number of chars that will be
stored in the destination string is equal to the length of the longer
string, +1 for the null char. For Str_concat, the number of chars that
will be stored in the destination string is equal to the sum of the
lengths of the two given strings, +1 for the null char. Since chars are
1 byte in C, the resultant char counts for Str_copy and Str_concat are
equal to the required destination memory. Therefore, we can use assert
to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is
large enough.
