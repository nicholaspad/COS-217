What is your mywc program test plan?

------Boundary Tests------
We want to test all scenarios where one of lLinCount, lWordCount, or
lCharCount is 0, since the lower bound of these variables is 0.

mywc0.txt: An empty file with no characters inside. Here we test the 
           boundary condition that lLineCount, lWordCount, lCharCount
           are all 0.
mywc1.txt: A file with only one space. Here we test the boundary 
           condition that lLineCount == 0, lWordCount == 0,
           lCharCount > 0.
mywc2.txt: A file with only one new line character. Here we test the
           boundary condition that lLineCount > 0, lWordCount == 0,
           lCharCount > 0.
mywc3.txt: A file with only one character that's not new line or space.
           Here we test the boundary condition that lLineCount == 0, 
           lWordCount > 0, lCharCount > 0.

------Statement Tests------
mywc4.txt: Contains (in order) a non-whitespace character, a new line
           character, a space, a non-whitespace character, a new line
           character, and a non-whitespace character. This file causes
           all statements to be executed.

------Stress Tests------
mywc5.txt: Contains 50000 randomly-generated valid ASCII characters.
           This stress tests the program because it causes the ingestion
           of a large number of characters, including randomly-generated
           new line and other whitespace characters. This triggers the
           program's statements randomly.
